# Web Recon Scripts

## Description
This repository contains some Python scripts designed to automate the process of reconnaissance for web security assessments. This aren't the exact scripts that I use daily, but were written/generated as a fun excercise. These scripts utilize various techniques for subdomain enumeration and interacting with APIs like Shodan to gather intelligence on specified targets.

## Tools Included
1. **Recon-Shodan**: This script performs domain intelligence using the Shodan API to find related information and services.
2. **Recon-Amass**: Leverages the Amass tool to perform extensive subdomain enumeration.
3. **Recon-DNSRecon**: Utilizes DNSRecon for detailed DNS gathering and subdomain discovery.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `scrapy`, `requests`, `shodan` (if using Shodan scripts)
- Tools: Amass, DNSRecon (ensure these are installed and accessible from your command line)
- Proper API keys where needed (e.g., Shodan API key)

## Installation
Clone this repository using:
```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url-here
```
Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Create a `lists` directory for any dictionary files used for DNSRecon or similar tools.

## Usage
Each script can be run independently, based on the needs of the reconnaissance process. For example, to run the Shodan reconnaissance script:
```bash
python recon-shodan.py <input-file-with-domains>
```

Replace `<input-file-with-domains>` with your file containing a list of domains to analyze.
